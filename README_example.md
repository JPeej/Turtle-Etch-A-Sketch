<h1 align="center">Turtle Etch A Sketch</h1>

I was tasked to create a Turtle Etch A Sketch in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day nineteen of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-OOP event listeners

-Higher order functions

<h2>What I learned</h2>
Some modules/libraries include funcitonality that will "listen" for the user to input key clicks. By using this listen feature within the turtle module I can control the turtle and effectively create a rough Etch a Sketch. Also, I was introduced to higher order functions which use functions within functions. This allowed my user inputs to do something within the screen. Using functions within functions seems pretty intuitive to me.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
I am happy with how these lessons went. No problems. Enjoying the learning process.
